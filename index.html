                    My name is Eric Kim.  I have a Bachelor of Arts in Music Industry and a Bachelor of Science in Electronic Engineering.  
                    I recently resigned as a District Manager of a sales organization to pursue other passions and to have more time to 
                    spend with my family.  Through my 14 years with the organization, I had the wonderful experience of living in multiple 
                    states and had the ability to travel across the country fairly frequently.  I spent a few years in California at the 
                    corporate office as the Manager of Sales Administration and Retail Support for the entire organization.  As a District 
                    Manager, I was not only responsible for motivating my direct reports, but also analyzing sales trends to maximize ebitda 
                    and generate incremental revenue.  While I did not have coding experience prior to attending the UPenn bootcamp program, 
                    I was proficent in Excel, specifically with Vlookup, Pivot tables, and VBA & Macros.

                    My wife Elizabeth works as an Economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  We have an incredible intelligent son who recently 
                    turned 5 years old in August of 2022.  As a family, we enjoy playing video and board games together.  My wife and I enjoy
                    Role Playing games that can be played cooperatively.  My son has a passion for Roblox and Minecraft and is getting fairly proficient
                    with redstone.  We also enjoy experiencing food from different cultures.
